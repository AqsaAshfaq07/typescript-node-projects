// Cars: 
// Write a function that stores information about a car in a Object. The function should always 
// receive a manufacturer and a model name. It should then accept an arbitrary number of keyword 
// arguments. Call the function with the required information and two other name-value pairs, such 
// as a color or an optional feature. Print the Object thatâ€™s returned to make sure all the 
// information was stored correctly.
