// send out a new set of invitations. You’ll have to think of someone else to invite.

// stating the name of the guest who can’t make it.
// • Modify your list, replacing the name of the guest who can’t make it with the name of the new 
// person you are inviting.
// • Print a second set of invitation messages, one for each person who is still in your list.

// informing people that you found a bigger dinner table.
// • Add one new guest to the beginning of your array.
// • Add one new guest to the middle of your array. • Use append() to add one new guest to the 
// end of your list. • Print a new set of invitation messages, one for each person in your list.

// Shrinking Guest List: You just found out that your new dinner table won’t arrive in time for the 
// dinner, and you have space for only two guests.
// • Start with your program from Exercise 16. Add a new line that prints a message saying that 
// you can invite only two people for dinner.
// • Remove guests from your list one at a time until only two names remain in your list. Each 
// time you pop a name from your list, print a message to that person letting them know you’re sorry 
// you can’t invite them to dinner.
// • Print a message to each of the two people still on your list, letting them know they’re still invited.
// • Remove the last two names from your list, so you have an empty list. Print your list to make 
// sure you actually have an empty list at the end of your program.
