// Adding Comments: Choose two of the programs you’ve written, and add at least one comment to each. 
// If you don’t have anything specific to write because your programs are too simple at this point, 
// just add your name and the current date at the top of each program file. Then write one sentence 
// describing what the program does.

let my_name:string = "AQSA";
let now = new Date();
console.log(`Het this is ${my_name} and currently its ${now}.`);

// This program is about to print the name and current date. ps. comments :)
